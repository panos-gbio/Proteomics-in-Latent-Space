# In this folder I saved the final features of the classifiers along with predicted dominant proteoform-proteoform interractions
- In the analysis we train the classifiers with dominant proteoforms (whose MS signal covariation bears great resemblance with their corresponded proteins) and predict PPI for the whole proteoform tables.
- Here we extract the features, and save the predicition results for the dominant forms.
